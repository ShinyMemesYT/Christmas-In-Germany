    <h1 class="maintext">German Christmas Traditions</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">A big part of Christmas in Germany is <big><big>Advent.</big></big><br>Several different types of Advent calendars are used in German homes.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">As well as the traditional one made of card that are used in many countries, there are ones made out of a wreath of Fir tree branches with 24 decorated boxes or bags hanging from it. Each box or bag has a little present in it.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">Another type is called a 'Advent Kranz' and is a ring of fir branches that has four candles on it. This is like the Advent candles that are sometimes used in Churches. One candle is lit at the beginning of each week in Advent.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">Another big part of Christmas in Germany is <big><big><big>Christmas Trees.</big></big>
        </big>
    </h1>
    <h1 class="facts">Christmas Trees are very important in Germany. They were first used in Germany during the Middle Ages. If there are young children in the house, the trees are usually secretly decorated by the mother of the family.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">
        The Christmas tree was traditionally brought into the house on Christmas eve. In some parts of Germany, during the evening the family would read the Bible and sing Christmas songs.</h1>
    <header class="maintext">German Vocabulary</header>
    <h1 class="facts">Some Christmas songs are O Tannenbaum, Ihr Kinderlein Kommet(your little one's coming) and Stille Nacht(Silent Night)</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">In German Happy/Merry Christmas is 'Frohe Weihnachten'.</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">Christmas Day being called “Erste Feiertag” ('first celebration') and the 26th December is known as "Zweite Feiertag” ('second celebration') and also “Zweiter Weihnachtsfeiertag” which translates as Boxing Day (although it doesn’t literally mean that)!</h1>
    <h1 class="maintext">Special People</h1>
    <h1 class="facts">In some parts of Germany, mainly the south east of the country, children write to the 'das Christkind/Christkindl' asking for presents. The letters to the Christkind are decorated with sugar glued to the envelope to make them sparkly and attractive to look at. Children leave the letters on the windowsill at the beginning of or during Advent.</h1>

    <h1 class="facts">'das Christkind' translates as 'The Christ Child' in English but Germans don't think of the Christkind as the baby Jesus! The Christkind is often described as a young girl with 'Christ like' qualities. In Nürnberg a young girl is chosen every year to participate in a parade as the Christkind. She wears a long white and gold dress, has long blond curly hair and wears a gold crown and sometimes wings like an angel. This is similar to St Lucia in Sweden. (And it can seem a bit confusing calling the 'Christ Child', Jesus, a girl!)</h1>

    <h1 class="facts">The Nürnberg Christkind officially opens the Christmas market on the Friday before Advent starts. And before Christmas she has over 150 'official duties' including visiting hospitals, old people's homes and children's nurseries! She also has to give TV interviews and visit other cities.</h1>

    <h1 class="facts">Santa Claus or Father Christmas (der Weihnachtsmann) brings the main Christmas presents on December 24th. You might also write a letter to Weihnachtsmann in other parts of Germany. Some people say that Santa/Father Christmas (Weihnachtsmann) brings the presents and some say it is Christkind!
    </h1>

    <h1 class="facts">As well as hoping for presents from Christkind or der Weihnachtsmann, children also hope that 'der Nikolaus' will bring you some small gifts, such as sweets and chocolate on the 6th December (St Nicholas's Day). He comes in the night between the 5th and the 6th and puts the presents into the shoes of the children, who usually place them by their doors on the previous evening.</h1>

    <h1 class="facts">In some regions of Germany, there is a character called "Knecht Ruprecht" or "Krampus" who accompanies Nikolaus (St. Nicholas) on the 6th of December. He is a big horned monster clothed in rags and carries chains. He is mean to punish the children who have been bad! He is usually the one who scares the little children.</h1>

    <h1 class="facts">In other parts of Germany, St. Nicholas is followed by a small person called "Schwarzer Peter" (Black Peter) who carries a small whip. Black Peter also accompanies St. Nicholas or Sinterklaas in Holland. In north west Germany Santa is joined by Belsnickel a man dressed all in fur. Although 'der Nikolaus' visits in December, he's not officially part of Christmas!</h1>
